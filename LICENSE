All wrongs reversed.

 You can do whatever you want with this program BUT there are three conditions:

   1.  You shall not rebrand the product and/or claim authorship of it.
      This is illegal, you know.
   2.  If you redistribute this software, you have to include this LICENSE
      file with the whole package.
   3.  You shall not, in any way, charge money for the software unless you are
      the original author or a trusted reseller.

 In case you're just using individual snippets of code from this program,
you're exempt from following the two last conditions.

 THIS SOFTWARE COMES WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. THE AUTHOR(S)
SHALL NEVER BE HELD RESPONSIBLE OF ANY DAMAGE CAUSED TO OR BY THE SOFTWARE.

 The Minor UnSX License for Software is meant to be simple and very open. You
can do anything you want as long as you respect the authorship of the program.
